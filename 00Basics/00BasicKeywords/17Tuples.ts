// 16 Tuples
// Tuples is a type that represents an array with a fixed number of elements, where each element can have a different type. The order of the types in the tuple definition corresponds to the order of the values in the actual array. Tuples are similar to arrays, but they have a specific structure and can be used to model finite sequence with know lengths.

// let mytuple: [string, number] = [42, 'string'] // error
let mytuple: [string, number] = ['string', 42]
